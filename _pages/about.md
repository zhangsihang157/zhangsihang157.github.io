I am an independent researcher specializing in data structures, graph theory, computer vision, chain-of-thought reasoning, and multimodal learning. 

I completed my undergraduate studies in [Optoelectronics](https://gdxy.qlu.edu.cn/) at [Qilu University of Technology](https://www.qlu.edu.cn/), where I developed a strong foundation in computational methods and analytical thinking. Since graduation, I have been pursuing independent research, focusing on the intersection of theoretical computer science and practical applications in visual computing. My current work explores innovative approaches to complex problem-solving by integrating structured data analysis with advanced machine learning techniques, particularly in the context of multimodal data processing and cognitive reasoning systems.
